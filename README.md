## Electron Package

It is recomended to use yarn as the package manager for Electron, as electron-forge supports it by default

electron-forge allows electrons app to be build for cross platform usage easily.

For more on how to build for different platforms check the electron-forge project

yarn install
yarn start //Run with cli
